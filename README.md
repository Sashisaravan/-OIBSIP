# Java Development Intern @ Oasis Infobyte

-> During my internship, I had the chance to work on two noteworthy projects. The first project was a Number Guessing Game, where the user tries to guess a number generated by the computer.
-> The second project involved developing a console-based ATM INTERFACE using JAVA. This project comprised different classes like withdraw and deposit, enabling users to view their bank details, check balances, and perform other related tasks.

The task 1 is a Number Guessing Game, where the user tries to guess a number generated by the computer.
